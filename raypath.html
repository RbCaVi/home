  <h1>it paths traces and rays marches!</h1>
  <p>
    i made this in a few days in december 2024 A D
  </p>
  <p>
    it's based on <a href = "https://androsis.carrd.co/">androsis's</a> <a href = "https://github.com/Androtis/OpenGL-Expirements">opengl experiments</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    it uses <a href = "https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/FrontPage">sdl 2</a> and <a href = "https://gen.glad.sh/">glad</a> with opengl version 1.3
  </p>
  <p>
    i took a couple of screenshots
  </p>
  <p>
    they're not compressed so you're downloading ~500kb-1mb per image and there's 50 of them
  </p>
  <p>
    good luck with your internet bill
  </p>
  <h2>first render!</h2>
  <p>
    two planes with a uv tiled "texture" (the green and blue are the u and v coordinates)
  </p>
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath1.png">
  <h2>sphere 1</h2>
  <p>
    its texture is the normal as rgb or something
  </p>
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath2.png">
  <h2>balls</h2>
  <p>
    mirror! - at this point, it only allowed one bounce (i was using recursion for reflections and opengl doesn't allow indefinite recursion)<br>
    also i added a framerate meter and view matrix visualizer
  </p>
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath3.png">
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath4.png">
  <h2>reflection but better</h2>
  <p>
    i fixed it so it could reflect "indefinitely" (capped at 5 bounces)
  </p>
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath5.png">
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath6.png">
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath7.png">
  <h2>what</h2>
  <p>
    jank in front/behind i guess
  </p>
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath8.png">
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath9.png">
  <h2>orthographic</h2>
  <p>
    i added orthographic/isometric view (and a key to smoothly interpolate between perspective and orthographic)
  </p>
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath10.png">
  <h2>raymarching</h2>
  <p>
    probably the main reason i made this<br>
    real raymarched objects in a mostly path traced world<br>
    they actually have a path traced bounding shape and then raymarch inside that shape<br>
    with this first one, i messed up the sdf a bit (centered the sphere on the origin and repeated a cube with one corner at the origin)
  </p>
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath11.png">
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath12.png">
  <p>
    i fixed the sdf
  </p>
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath13.png">
  <p>
    after large amounts of time, floating point rounding errors mess up the random sampler i used to show the raymarched area
  </p>
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath14.png">
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath15.png">
  <h2>distance view</h2>
  <p>
    distance debug view<br>
    was useful to diagnose the issues with the raymarched object (i wasn't multiplying some factors)
  </p>
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath16.png">
  <p>
    the sphere cube in all its glory
  </p>
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath17.png">
  <p>
    i added a plain raymarched sphere at some point too
  </p>
  <img class = "raypath-image" src = "raypath-assets/raypath18.png">
  <p>
    and of course they show up in reflections
  </p>
