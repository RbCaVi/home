  <h1>parserlang</h1>
  <p>(dm me if you have a better name)</p>
  <h2>things you probably already know:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>parserlang is a programming language</li>
    <li>i made it to write parsers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>anyway, on to the things you may not know</p>
  <h2>things you may not know: pv</h2>
  <p>
    because i made it to write parsers, one of the features i have planned is simple backtracking
  </p>
  <p>
    like when you're (i was) writing a recursive descent parser with parser combinators, the concat combinator is hard to write in a non recursive way (you have to write your own stack)
  </p>
  <p>
    so that's one feature i planned
  </p>
  <p>
    then to have backtracking in a "sane" way, the values have to be immutable
  </p>
  <p>
    at some point i thought "oh jq does basically the same thing right?" and copied the entire jv (jq value) implementation and called it pv
  </p>
  <p>
    (and quickly found out how much the different jv kinds (types) reference internal details)
  </p>
  <p>
    so i just copied (most of) the header files and some of the implementation for the more complex kinds
  </p>
  <p>
    but now i'm mostly done with rewriting jv in a way that i like
  </p>
  <p>
    so it has immutable values like jv and 7 kinds: null, bool, int, double, string, array, object - the only change i made is split number into int and float
  </p>
  <p>
    it also has some functions with single or double dispatch - equal, hash, to_string
  </p>
  <h2>pl</h2>
  <p>
    now on top of pv i made pl, which is a based stack vm (like lua)
  </p>
  <p>
    it's not too unusual (i think) - there are a couple of opcode sections:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>stack manipulation - dup swap pop</li>
    <li>empty constructors - null bool int double array object</li>
    <li>push global value? (not sure if this is something i will use)</li>
    <li>various array and object functions - set get len etc.</li>
    <li>number operators - <code>+</code> <code>-</code> <code>*</code> <code>/</code> etc.</li>
    <li>call (of course)</li>
    <li>jumps - conditional and unconditional</li>
    <li>iteration - constructor and usage (and backtracking iteration but i haven't added that yet)</li>
    <li>two return opcodes - return/yield and end generator</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    there are also two additional kinds - func and iter (function and iterator obviously)
  </p>
  <p>
    i currently have functional iteration and function calls - both as normal function and as generator
  </p>
  <p>
    there's also an assembler, which takes code like this:
  </p>
  <p style = "white-space: pre; font-family: monospace;">def n1 num 4
def n2 num 34
def a arr n1 n2

defglobals add a
defmain main

func add
  // takes 2 arguments
  add
  ret
endfunc

func main
  pushglobal 0
  pushint 15
  pushint 52
  call 2
  ret
endfunc</p>
  <p>
    and a debug code executor (which can execute that assembled code):
  </p>
  <p style = "white-space: pre; font-family: monospace;">main bytecode:
PUSHGLOBAL 0
PUSHINT 15
PUSHINT 52
CALL 2
RET

return value:
.: 67

global 0:
.: idk it has kind 8 (pl_func)

global 1:
.: []
./0: 4.000000
./1: 34.000000</p>
  <h2>oOoOoOoOo the compiler</h2>
  <p>
    and finally, i'm writing a compiler
  </p>
  <a href = "pl_exec_run">check out some tests (it runs .plp files, which you can get if you clone parserlang yourself (the python scripts, especially pl_parse.py))</a>
