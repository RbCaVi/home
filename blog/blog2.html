it was a really annoying mosquito<br>
i was doing a math test today<br>
and one of the problems was:<br>
if you have a "word" with five distinct letters, (just say they're abcde)<br>
and the number of each letter is n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, n<sub>3</sub>, n<sub>4</sub>, n<sub>5</sub>, respectively<br>
prove the number of anagrams of that "word" is equal to:<br>
(n<sub>1</sub> + n<sub>2</sub> + n<sub>3</sub> + n<sub>4</sub> + n<sub>5</sub>)!/(n<sub>1</sub>! n<sub>2</sub>! n<sub>3</sub>! n<sub>4</sub>! n<sub>5</sub>!)<br>
so i went "i'm not writing out n<sub>1</sub> + n<sub>2</sub> + n<sub>3</sub> + n<sub>4</sub> + n<sub>5</sub> choose n<sub>1</sub> times n<sub>2</sub> + n<sub>3</sub> + n<sub>4</sub> + n<sub>5</sub> choose n<sub>2</sub> times ... times n<sub>5</sub> choose n<sub>5</sub>"<br>
i decided to instead prove that this formula is true for any number of distinct letters >:)<br>
definitely much less work :)<br>
the formula in question: with N distinct letters, the number of anagrams is sum(i = 1 -> N of n<sub>i</sub>)!/product(i = 1 -> N of n<sub>i</sub>!)<br>
and obviously the claim is this formula with N = 5<br>
i obviously could have done the simple combinatoric proof with ways to place n<sub>1</sub> copies of a in n<sub>1</sub> + n<sub>2</sub> + n<sub>3</sub> + n<sub>4</sub> + n<sub>5</sub> spaces<br>
but you know how i am (you probably don't)
